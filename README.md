# 100 days of Rust DeFi
## Week 1: Blockchain Foundamentals

Basic concepts:
Block:
- Information about confirmed transactions.
- Header: hash of previous block, timestamps, Mekle root (hash of all block transactions), Nonce, Difficulity target, Version, and more...


Hash:
- SHA256 (or another algoritm) of block header.
- One direction function - non reversible.

Validation
- Comparing new transaction with self stored Blockchain. Check all blockchain rules.
- Check PoW.
- Verify merkle root.
- Verify previous hash.

Specific to Solana:
- Slot (~400ms - 800ms) when the leader can make a block.
- PoH (Proof of History). It profs that the time moves by making continous hashing with timestamps. It is a cryptographic clock.
- Continous hashing: hash_n = hash(hash_n-1 + timestamp)
- Transaction added to PoH hashing.
